# Phased Array Antenna Analysis

This is a bunch of python scripts to simulate, analyize and plot the results of different simulations conducted in STK and CST Microwave Studio.

There are basically three different parts:

	- CST result analysis
	- STK result analysis
	- Python scripts for simulating the fields of phased array and patch antennas
